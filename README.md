Dependencies:

Matlab 2021a
Data acquisition toolbox
Instrument control toolbox (provides udp component)
In matlab you also need to install the Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices

27.10.25: it appears you do not need to install NI Max etc. this seems to come packaged in the Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package..
